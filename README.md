# Perceptron-Network
# Design a Perceptron Network to classify English Alphabets "I" or "O" using MATLAB 
Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks. Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary). Also, it is used in supervised learning. It helps to classify the given input data.
